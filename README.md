# GUIBanner
The GUI Banner Plugin for Minecraft

This plugin is a beautifully designed GUI menu for tempbanning players on your server! This plugin was designed after the ban plugin used on the Performium Server that was created by one of the Owners: rgaminecraft! Although this plugin has minor changes than the original plugin as seen on the Performium Server, it is still a fantastic tool for all Server Owners and Moderators! All you need to do is type "/tempban <Player_Name>", and it will open up a nice menu for you to select whether to continue with the banning process, or to cancel it. If you decide to continue, then all you have to do is click on the option that says "Tempban Menu," and it will open up a new menu with 18 different ban options, ranging from XRAY to Permanent Bans! It's as simple as that!
To reload the config file after any changes, just do '/guireload'
